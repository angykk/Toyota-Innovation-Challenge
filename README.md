# Toyota-Innovation-Challenge

This was created as a part of the Toyota Innovation Challenge Hackathon, where participants had to code an algorithm for the turtlebot, capable of both keyboard control or automated movement. Features included collision detection and stopping when a stop sign is detected using machine learning.
